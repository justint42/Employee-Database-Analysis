# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose 

The purpose of this analysis is to learn and utilize Standard Query Language (via pgAdmin 4) to manage relational databases. In this case the user is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. What valuable information can be attained by our analysis?

- Per the eligible retiree age table, a substantial percentage of the workforce can retire at any moment. 
- Most potential retirees are general Staff and Senior Engineers. 
- Some retirees are also eligible for the mentorship program; can bolster the younger workforce skillset as they take over.
- However, there seems to be not enough potential mentors to cover for the remaining workforce. The consequences of this difference will depend on actual retiring numbers.


## Summary

Our observations should be read within the context of potentially retiring employees from 1962 to 1965. Potential mentors may be of other ages. We may identify younger proteges by their output and additions to the company and pool them into a 'first-serve' category so that we can allocate our mentors more effectively. This is one solution to mitigate lower-quantity workforce.
