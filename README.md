# Employee-Database-Management

## Purpose 

"Pewlett Hackard" is a large company boasting several thousand employees and it's been around for a long time. As babt boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate Pewlett Hackard is looking toward the future in two ways. First, it's offering a retirement package for those that meet certain criteria. Second, it's starting to think about which positions need to be filled in the near future. The number of upcoming retirements will leave thousands of job openings. 

What would happen to a company if they didn't look ahead and prepare for this many vacancies? It probably woudn't be pretty. My task is to perform employee research.

The purpose of this analysis is to answer the following questions: Who will be retiring in the nedxt few years, and how many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill? This analysis will help future-proof Pewlett-Hackard by generating a list of all employees eligible for the package retirement.

- Per the eligible retiree age table, a substantial percentage of the workforce can retire at any moment. 
- Most potential retirees are general Staff and Senior Engineers. 
- Some retirees are also eligible for the mentorship program; can bolster the younger workforce skillset as they take over.
- However, there seems to be not enough potential mentors to cover for the remaining workforce. The consequences of this difference will depend on actual retiring numbers.


## Summary

Our observations should be read within the context of potentially retiring employees from 1962 to 1965. Potential mentors may be of other ages. We may identify younger proteges by their output and additions to the company and pool them into a 'first-serve' category so that we can allocate our mentors more effectively. This is one solution to mitigate lower-quantity workforce.
